<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This site is a manifestation Chandrakant Redican's yet another side project. I am learning HTML, Javascript and CSS all on my own so I can do some fun interactive storytelling on the web.
    I'm hosted with GitHub Pages because I found out it is free as long as it does not get too big.
    Well we all know that is not a problem.. lol
    
    There is a twine game I am working on the link is <a href="https://poetryisprotest.github.io/theamrstory.html">here!</a>

    The first dumb page I ever created is <a href="https://poetryisprotest.github.io/new.html">here!</a>
