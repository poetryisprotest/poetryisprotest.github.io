<h3>Welcome to my page: Poetry is Protest</h3>
<p>This is a small corner of the internet- my small corner. Not meant to
be a big site or go viral (like all my other plans) but to be a place
where I try and learn new things in HTML, CSS, JS and Interactive
Fiction through my Twine stories.</p>
<p>There are many things I would like to share. But first and foremost,
I will be sharing the things I have learned here. And the places that
have helped me learn.</p>
<h3>Tools:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Converting markdown to HTML: This is a neat little tool called
Pandoc, which I <a href="https://pandoc.org/try">use online</a>.</li>
<li>IMGBB to host my image files. It is easy to make hot links
there</li>
<li>Opendrive to host my audio files, things like background music,
sound effects etc.</li>
<li>Additionally <a href="https://jukehost.co.uk/">Jukehost</a> is also
a nice free option to host audio files for sound effects!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Absolute beginner tutorials in <a
href="https://www.adamhammond.com/htmlguide/">HTML and CSS</a> by <a
href="www.adamhammond.com">Adam Hammond</a> were very useful. As were
his <a href="https://www.adamhammond.com/twineguide/">twinery
tutorials</a>. -W3 Schools for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">HTML
and CSS documentation</a> -Markdown reference <a
href="https://commonmark.org/help/">guide and tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are here and want to know more about me and my other, more
finished work. I suggest you visit my <a
href="www.chandrakant.ink">website</a>.</p>
<p>See you around! Stay healthy, stay happy and say NO to drugs! (and
fascism).</p>
